# Project: Personal Budget App (React Native + Web)

## What this is
A personal budget management app, rebuilt from a single-file HTML/JS proof of concept
into a production React Native (Expo) app targeting iOS, Android, and Web from one
codebase. Full requirements live in `docs/SRS-presupuesto-app.md` — always check it
before implementing a feature, and treat it as the source of truth over anything
assumed here.

## Tech stack (locked decisions — do not change without asking)
- **Framework:** Expo (React Native), managed workflow
- **Web:** react-native-web, same codebase as mobile (see SRS NFR-5 for the one
  condition under which we'd reconsider this)
- **Backend/DB:** Firebase — Firestore for data, with offline persistence enabled as
  the local cache (no separate local DB)
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentication — email/password, Google, Facebook
- **State management:** Zustand
- **Charts:** react-native-svg or Victory Native (decide at implementation time, note
  the choice here once picked)
- **Language:** TypeScript, strict mode
- **i18n:** structured translation files, Spanish + English at launch, extensible
- **Currency:** never hardcoded — always driven by user's default currency setting
  and per-record currency/exchange-rate fields (see SRS 6.7)

## Folder structure conventions
Propose a structure before scaffolding if one doesn't exist yet, but default to
feature-based organization (not type-based) once the app has more than a couple of
screens, e.g.:

```
/app or /src
  /features
    /expenses
    /income
    /budget
    /history
    /auth
    /settings
  /components       (shared, generic UI components only)
  /lib              (firebase config, firestore converters, helpers)
  /store            (zustand stores)
  /localization
  /theme
```

Keep business logic (calculations, Firestore read/write, sync logic) out of components —
components should be presentation-focused, logic should live in hooks/store/lib so it's
testable and shared cleanly between native and web.

## Working process — read this before starting any task
- **One stage at a time.** Work is scoped to the numbered stages in
  `docs/SRS-presupuesto-app.md` section 11 (Build Stages). Don't implement ahead of
  the current stage even if it seems convenient — flag it instead and ask.
- **Plan before code for anything non-trivial.** Propose an implementation plan/diff
  outline first for review, especially for anything touching data model, Firestore
  schema, or security rules. Straightforward, well-specified tasks (e.g. "add this
  field to this form") can go straight to implementation.
- **Ask before:**
  - Adding a new dependency/package
  - Changing anything in the tech stack table above
  - Touching Firestore security rules
  - Changing the data model/schema once real data exists
  - Any decision the SRS doesn't clearly answer
- **Don't ask before:** routine scaffolding, boilerplate CRUD screens, standard
  refactors within an already-agreed structure, writing tests.

## Code style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` unless truly unavoidable (comment why if used)
- Functional components, hooks — no class components
- Prefer small, focused components and hooks over large files
- Comment *why*, not *what*, for anything non-obvious (e.g. why an exchange rate is
  stored at entry time rather than computed live — see SRS FR-16)

## Data integrity reminders (from SRS — easy to accidentally violate)
- Deleting a record never hard-deletes immediately — see SRS FR-4a/b/c (Archive → Trash
  → permanent purge with confirmation)
- Deleting/archiving/trashing a recurring definition must not delete its historical
  payment records (FR-4d), and must stop future regeneration (FR-4e)
- Exchange rates are stored per-record at time of entry, never recalculated
  retroactively (FR-16)
- Rolling budget average window is fixed at 6 months (FR-6a) — not user-configurable
- Income now mirrors expenses' paid/unpaid model (FR-5c) — `date` is the
  expected/due date, `paidDate` is when it was actually received; don't conflate
  the two (see `docs/data-model.md` §6)

## Testing strategy
Don't defer testing wholesale — split by volatility, not by "do it all at the end":

- **Write unit tests as you build**, alongside any pure business-logic function —
  these are cheap, stable, and don't churn when the UI changes later:
  - Rolling 6-month average / budget recommendation calc (FR-6a-6d)
  - Currency conversion and exchange-rate handling (FR-14-18)
  - Recurring date regeneration logic — monthly/biweekly/weekly (FR-2, FR-5b)
  - Archive/Trash state transitions — must not delete history, must stop
    regeneration (FR-4a-4e)
- **Test Firestore security rules early**, using the Firebase emulator — a rules
  bug is a security hole, not just an inconvenience, and is unreliable to verify
  by hand.
- **Defer component/UI tests and E2E tests** until the corresponding screens have
  stabilized — these churn heavily during active design/layout iteration, so writing
  them early wastes effort re-writing them as things change.

## Git conventions
- One branch per SRS stage (or sub-task within a large stage)
- Commit messages reference the stage/FR number where relevant, e.g.
  `feat: implement archive/trash flow (Stage 11, FR-4a-4c)`
- No direct commits to `main` — even solo, work through branches so stages can be
  reviewed/reverted independently

## Current stage
_(Update this line as work progresses — tells Claude Code where we are without
re-explaining context each session.)_

Stage: **2 — Expo + react-native-web project scaffold**
